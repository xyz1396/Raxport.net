### .NET version of Raxport

Raxport is a simple program which extracts scans from raw files generated by mass spectrometers from ThermoFisher. It supports both Orbitrap and IonTrap scans. However, the generated `.FT1` or `.FT2` files will include charge information only if the scan is from an Orbitrap. Currently, only MS1 and MS2 scans are supported.

### Run it on Windows

```bash
.\Raxport.exe -i 'input path' -o 'output path' -j 'threads number'
```

### Run it on Linux or MAC

```bash
./Raxport -i 'input path' -o 'output path' -j 'threads number'
```

### To split 20,000 scans per `.FT2` file

```bash
./Raxport -i 'input path' -o 'output path' -s 20000 -j 'threads number'
```

### Scans in Generated `.FT1` File

The format of `.FT1` is shown in the following picture. All chunks are split by tabs. 
- The first "H" line contains software information. 
- The second "H" line contains column names for peaks. 
- The third "H" line contains the instrument model. 

Each scan has a scan header and a peaks information table. 
- The "S" line in the scan header contains the scan number and TIC (total ion current). 
- The first "I" line contains the retention time. 
- The second "I" line contains the scan type. 
- The third "I" line contains the scan filter.

### Scans in Generated `.FT2` File

The format of `.FT2` is shown in the following picture. All chunks are split by tabs. 
- The first "H" line contains software information. 
- The second "H" line contains column names for peaks. 
- The third "H" line contains the instrument model. 

Each scan has a scan header and a peaks information table. 
- The "S" line in the scan header contains the scan number, precursor m/z, and TIC (total ion current). 
- The "Z" line contains the precursor charge, precursor mass, and other precursor charges and m/z values. 
- The first "I" line contains the retention time. 
- The second "I" line contains the scan type. 
- The third "I" line contains the scan filter. 
- The "D" line contains the scan number of the precursor.

### Compile it in Visual Studio

Raxport.net is developed under .NET 8 and relies on `ThermoFisher.CommonCore.RawFileReader.dll` and `ThermoFisher.CommonCore.Data.dll` from [FreeStyle of ThermoFisher](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/RawFileReader). You can clone this project and compile it in Visual Studio. See the ![note.md](./note.md) for additional details.
